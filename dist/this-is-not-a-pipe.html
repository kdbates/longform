          <strong>In 1929</strong>, then thirty years old, Belgian surrealist painter René Magritte completed a painting called La Trahison des Images (The Treachery of Images). It was a painting of a (smoking) pipe, and underneath it Magritte wrote, Ceci n’est pas une pipe (This is not a pipe). The painter, who died in 1967, was making the point that symbols are not reality, retrospectively saying: </p>

              It is a quick jump for students of A Course in Miracles to see the Platonic influence at work here—the difference
              between appearance (symbol) and reality (source)—the philosophical tradition within which the Course’s teachings
              fit so comfortably. Things are not what they appear to be because things are not real. Being mere projections (or
              extensions) of the mind, they—in fact, everything in the material universe—represent or symbolize in form the
              decision-making mind’s thoughts of the ego or Holy Spirit. Consider these excerpts from the early workbook lessons that reflect the relationship between our thoughts and perceptions:

                No one really sees anything. He sees only his thoughts
                projected outward (W-pI.8.1:2-3).
